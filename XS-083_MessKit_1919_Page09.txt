SURE, Micky Brennan
has kissed the Blarney
Stone! Micky of the
Eighteenth has click¬
ed his hobnails
ferninst ould Blarney
Castle! Micky has
pressed his lips to the
shtone that makes the
tongue av ye that
smooth ye kin talk rings ar-r-round all
the ginerals and privates and military
po-lice in th' wur-r-rld!
Micky tuk a tr-rip to England and
shtopped off at th’ gr-rand ould Imerald
Isle to lood into the Irish question.
While Micky was in London he saw
King George and said to him, says he,
“Th’ top o’ the mornin’ to ye, sir!”, and
a few other observa-a-tions he had had
in his moind fer some time. But what
with the bands a-playin’ and every-
body cheerin’ for Micky and th’ King,
Micky’s remarks cud not be heard at
all, at all!
Micky came home by way av th’
Wistern Front and he says he cud tell,
jist by lookin’ around, that there had
been some foightin’ Irishmen in the
pla-a-ce.
When Micky was visitin’ Blarney
Castle he wanted to br-r-ing the castle
and the Blarney Stone home with him
for a souvenir, but they said no, he cud
only carry a hundred and sivinty-foive
pounds av baggage.
YANK SMOKERS FIND NEW
USE FOR FRENCH HILLS.
What are French hills good for? A
good many things, but it was learned
the other day that some of the 18th En¬
gineers found a new use for them on the
arrival of their regiment in France. At
that time there was a considerable
shortage of American tobacco. When
a soldier wanted to “roll one”, he hunt-
ed up a goodsized hill, climbed over
the top, sat down on the slope farthest
from camp and enjoyed a solitary
smoke, without the necessity of giving
“makin’s” to the rest of the regiment.
Suggestions to husbands who are late getting home from the club: Call wifey
up and hold a peace conference over the telephone.
No More Chips.
The ex-kaiser is reported to be
chopping wood. It's a safe bet he
isn't putting any of the chips on his
shoulder.
If Germany Can, We Can.
We are informed that the German
ex-crown-princess voted the other day,
Every buck privates wife, sister and
sweetheart should have the same priv-
ilege at presidential elections in the
States.
International Police.
When we have an international po¬
lice force, it will seem strange for
tourists to be told to move on when
they are caught loitering at the corner
of Spain Street and France Avenue.
But it will be convenient to have an
international traffic cop on hand to
prevent imperial motor cars from
speeding across the Holland border.
May Be Out of Practice.
"Our cook is thinking of applying
for one of those proposed international
medals”, said the engineer private.
"On what grounds?", asked the
doughboy ditto.
"He says he can prepare French
fried potatoes, English breakfast bason
and lobster à l'Americaine".
But Why Think About It?
The British government is discussing
“more beer, better beer, and cheaper
beer". As for the United States—
Up and Up.
The price of hosiery is going up.
Why use garters? Our sox will never
come down, anyhow.
One Danger Obviated. 
They are talking of exploring the
Arctic regions in airplanes. There will
not be much danger of an airplane
explorer being caught in an ice floe.
May Come to It.
A heavy increase is reported in the
fares of traveling theatrical companies.
Looks as though the comic paper
barnstormer who walks the railroad
ties were about to become a reality
They Need ’Em. 
The British Army and Navy Club in
Paris is reported to have 300 pairs of
dancing slippers on hand for the use of
men on leave. The must have had
some unfortunate experiences with
waxed floors and hobnailed shoes.
What To Expect.
They are inaugurating the custom
of serving tea on British trains. Soon
we’ll have to do the same thing in the
States, in lieu of something stronger.
A Hoped-for “Crisis".
If the League of Nations gets on the
job, gunpowder and dynamite may
some day be as scarce as flour and
sugar are today.

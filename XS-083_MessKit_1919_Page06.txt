THE MESS KIT.
YANK BALLOONIST EMPTIES
PISTOL ON HUN AIRMAN.
“One ot the most exciting angles of
modern warfare is without doubt the
aerial combats”, said one of the Yanks
who had been up at the front. “One
fight I witnessed was between Boche
and American airplanes and American
observation balloons.
“Two German planes came over with
the evident intention of destroying the
balloons. The sky was fairly clear,
except for a heavy bank of clouds in
the offing.
“Two American planes, which were
guarding the balloons, darted forward
to meet the enemy. The German planes
turned tail and the Americans gave
chase. When they were a considerable
distance away, a third plane swooped
down and the Jerry punctured two of
the balloons with his machine gun fire.
He had been lying in wait up there for
just such a chance.
“In the third balloon was a youngster
who was nervy and a quick thinker.
The American planes had turned and
were speeding back. The Jerry tried
to make his getaway. As he swooped
down past the basket of the third bal¬
loon, the observer hung out over the
edge and emptied his automatic at the
German aviator. But luck was with
the Jerry that time and he made his
getaway."
AEROPLANE DARTS HARD
ON WARTIME RUBBERERS.
"Silent messengers of death” is the
appellation given by one of the artillery
men to the deadly aeroplane dart.
These darts are made of steel and are
about the size and shape of a lead
pencil.
One day this particular Yank was
standing at the mouth of a dugout to
watch one of the “Jerrys” as he came
sailing over. He and several of his
companions were bareheaded, although
a few of the boys had taken the precau-
tion of putting on their steel helmets.
I noticed something fall through
the foliage of a nearby tree”, said the
artilleryman. “It stripped off a few
leaves as it fell. When the enemy
plane had passed over, I went out to
see what the Jerry had dropped. I
found several little steel darts lying on
the ground or buried in the earth, point
down. Those that had struck stones
and other hard objects were flattened
on the end.
"This was our first experience with
airplane darts. None of the boys was
injured, but one fellow in my outfit
had a close call.
“'They pretty near got me that time’,
he said, and showed us the strap that
held the pouch in which he carried his
gas mask. The strap had been cut half
in two by one of the darts."
HOW WE LEARN FRENCH.
Soldiers All Get Off to Flying
Start and Everybody Grabs Pole, but
Few Finish by Mastering the Tongue.
LINGUISTIC STARS FADE.
LEARNING French is an
art that has proven to
have had many ups
and downs, pit-falls
and criss-crosses for
the American soldier
in France. Some of
them had had a smat¬
tering of French in
their school days, but
the vast majority didn’t know French
from Greek. But all of them invariably
started out with the same idea as soon
as they set foot on French soil—they’d
learn it within a short time. And most
of them have wound up at the same
place—oh, diable! what’s the use; we’re
going home soon.
The average American, arriving in
France, is rather surprised that before
sundown of the first day he knows
“oui” is yes”, that “combien” is “how
much”, that “cinq francs” is “five
francs”, that “vin rouge” is “red wine"
and thât “promenade” is “walk" and
so on.
This is easy, he thinks. "Before a
month l’ll have this lingo down pretty
good."
He learns to conjugate “avoir” and
“être”, “donner” and finir”, picks up
a few more words by adding “café
noir”, “rhum chaud” and “chambre”
to his vocabulary. By the end of the
month he is able to read the commu¬
niqué good enough in the French paper
to ascertain that the French have
re-crossed the Somme and that the
municipality will sell vegetables in the
public square Wednesday and Friday
mornings.
He’s pretty good now, but is rather
peeved when the French people with
whom he converses “can’t understand
their own language”. But he gives the
natives the benefit of the doubt and
puts off mastering the tongue for an¬
other month. Then he decides to make
it a year. At the end of the year he is
ready to confess that he doesn’t know
as much as he did at the start and has
quit trying as hè’s going home soon.

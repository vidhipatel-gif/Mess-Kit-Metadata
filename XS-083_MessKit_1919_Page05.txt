OLD SONG FOUND TRUE.
Gee, But lt's Great to Meet Pal From
Home Town, When Wounded
And Limping On Way to Rear.

GEE, but it's great to
meet a pal from your
home town!” was the
refrain of a popular
song that was getting
over big” in the States
some sesonsago. I
is not likely that the
author ever realized
that the truth of that
sentiment would be
proved a few years later in the greatest
war in history. But some Yank or
other is meeting a pal from his home
town every day in the year. Sometimes
it is in one of the base ports, sometimes
on furlough, sometimes when he his
skidding with his hobnails through
the slipper French mud of the country 
or over the slippery French cobble-
stones of the city.
Here is one case where the “pals"
had never known each other before,
but became pals through the fact that
they had come from the same “home
town”. “It was during the last fighting
in the Argonne region”, said a conya¬
lescent American soldier, in telling the
incident, “and I had just stopped a
couple of handfuls of Jerry’s high
explosive. I crawled up in the seat
of an ambulance bound for the rear.
I was feeling kind of bum about that
time— didn’t care much whether school
kept or not. Got to thinking about old
Forty-second Street. The car started
up and every time we’d hit a hole or a
rock my head would bang against the
framework of the car. But it couldn’t
knock the thoughts of old Forty-second
Street out of my head.
“There was another guy on the seat
beside the driver and the driver started
talking to him about Forty-second
Street. I said, “Just as a favor, don’t
talk about Forty-second Street just
now.” He turned to me and said,
"Why? Are you from New York?"
I told him I was. “So’m l”, said he.
“Put’er there, pal!” It’s great to meet
a pal from your home town, no matter
how big the town is."
DONT TRY TO
DOMESTICATE HIM!
Since his return from
overseas
No cushioned chair can
tempt him. 
On barracks floors he's
sat till he's
Quite hardened; so,
exempt him!
A "MOVING"
SPECTACLE.
Ex-Private Buck and
his best girl appearing
in "Back to Civvy Life”,
a Four Foot Reel.
WITHIN THE MILITARY LAW.
"I turned my back on an officer yes-
terday." remarked a meek looking little
private.
"What happened?", another “ordinaire"
inquired.
"Nothing. The officer had just given
the order About Face'."
NECTAR OF THE SEA GODS.
The prohibitionists had dumped all
the banned beverages into the ocean.
“How fortunate”, observed Neptune,
“that when young I acquired the habit
of putting salt in my beer!"
WEVE ALL HEARD
THIS FELLOW.
Said Privrate Dubb, "I've
borne the brunt
Of war; the plough-
share's charm
Calls me again!" (He'd
missed the Front;
He'd never seen a farm.)
APOLOGIES TO
LONGFELLOW.
The buck, a mighty man
is he;
With pride his chest
expands.
His service stripes,
which number three,
Are bright as golden
bands.
ONLY THING HE COULD SAY.
First Private:—They're going to prohibit
the use of tobacco and profanity in the
States.
Second Private:—Holy Smoke!
WRONG END TO.
"Why was your transportation to the
States held up? You went through the
Decootie-ing Station, didn’t you?"
"Yes, but I went in the exit and came
out the entrance and instead of getting
de-cootied, I got cootied.”
NEW USES FOR
THE HELMET.
Though in less peaceful
times 'twas plann'd
To turn a bursting
shell, a
Buck now has at his
command
A washbowl, or um-
brella.
AN AFTER
THE WAR VICTIM.
He neither dreaded liquid
flame,
Nor feared asphyxiation.
A collar, donned in
Fashion's name,
Brought death of strangu¬
lation.
Let it be recorded in the World's diary that the Statue of Liberty
still has but one hand above her head.

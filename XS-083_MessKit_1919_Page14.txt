THE MESS KIT.
FRANCE IS MORE LIKE HOME SWEET HOME
SINCE SWEETMEATS CAME BACK IN STYLE.
"GOTT MIT UNS!"
A GOOD
GERMAN WHOM
WE CAN ALL TRUST.
CHOCOLATE eclairs or,
as the French call
them, éclair au choco¬
lat, furnished a laugh
line in “Excuse Me”,
the popular comedy
of several seasons ago,
when a French poodle
mistook the thumb of
a colored porter for one of those delica¬
cies. A French poodle born within the
last year or so would never make such
a mistake, for chocolate eclair have
been practically unknown in France,
ever since Mars got in his deadly anti-
sweet-tooth work. But now that the
world is less busy manufacturing mu-
nitions of war, General Éclair au Cho-
colat and his entire army of sweets,
which the French class under the head
of “Quelque Chose de Bon”, is prepar
ing to march once more through the
triumph arch whose keystone is sup-
ported by pillars of sugar.
One by one, the pâtisseries are
opening again and cakes and sweet
biscuits are already running a neck
and neck race with fromage and wal¬
nuts as desert in the restaurants and
on Monsieur’s and Madame’s table.
“Of course”, the French say, with a
touch of regret in their tones, “it is
not like the old days, before the war
Then, oh, you should have been here
to taste the candies, and ice creams,
and cakes and deserts. Pâtisserie, you
know, has been a fine art in France for
many centuries."
Just as it takes more than one season
to build up a winning baseball or
football team, so it will be some little
time before the temporarily lost art
of “pâtisserie” comes entirely into its
own again. In the meantime, General
Éclair au Chocolat is beginning to mo¬
bilize his forces once more. The
buck private or “simple soldat” of the
sweetmeat army is the plain ordinary
“biscuit”. In the States he goes under
the effeminate pseudonym of “Ladyfin¬
gers”. His uniform resembles that of
the Yank rather than the poilu, for his
color is nearer olive drab than blue.
He was the hardiest specimen of French
pâtisserie known to the art, for, where
the more highly decorative and deli¬
cately moulded cakes and tarts suc¬
cumbed to the rigours of modern war
restrictions, Buck Private Ladyfingers
stood his ground.
Other goodies which are slowly but
surely making their appearance fol¬
lowing a gradual lightening of the
restrictions upon things “défendu” are
Baba au Rhum, Pavé, Chou à la Crème,
Tartelette, Tarte aux Cerises, Éclair au
Café, and Crème renversée. Those
who look back regretfully to the days
of the real Crème Renversée, say that
delicaty is Paradise with a sugar
coating on it.
TOWN CRIER STILL ON
JOB IN ADVANCE ZONE.
In old days the town crier was a recog-
nized institution throughout France
and many other countries as well. But
when the art of printing came in, the
newspapers drove the town crier out of
business. However, there are parts of
France where the town crier still makes
his announcements as in the days of
old, according to one of the members
of A Company, 18th Engineers.
In an obscure little village near the
town where this unit is camped, there
is an old man who stands at the main
street corner and beats a drum to attract
the attention of the populace when he
has an announcement to make. He is
the only newspaper they have, When
the armistice was signed, the news was
given out in this manner by the old
fown crier.
Why He Was Thankful.
"I’m glad l’m not a Hindu soldier”,
remarked the private who was always
late to formations.
“Why?”, asked the sergeant who was
always calling him down for that
failing.
“It's bad enough”, responded the
chronically tardy one, “to get my legs
dressed in time for Reveille, let alone
wrapping an extra spiral leggin around
my head."
ENGINEER TRIES HAND
AT RUNNING STREETCAR.
All sorts of stories are brought back
by the boys when they come home to
the company after their furloughs are
done. A private in one of the engineer
units brought this one back with him:
“As most of you fellows know, I was
a streetcar motorman in my civilian
days. It turned out that I had a chance
to try my hand at my old business here
in France not long ago. I spent part of
my vacation in one of the base ports.
where women motor “men” are all
the go.
“I was riding on the front platform
of one of the cars and explained to the
woman who was running it that I was
in the same line 'chez moi’. When we
had discussed the relative points of
French and American cars, the young
woman, convinced of my ability to
handle a French 'tram’ in an emerg-
ency, stooped over and whispered a
confidence in my ear.
“The fact was, such an emergency
was at hand. It appeared that part of
the young woman’s wardrobe, one of
her lisle stockings, in fact, had worked
loose from its moorings and was about
to obey the laws of gravity.
“Like a true gentleman and soldier
I flew to her aid. I seized the controller
bar and, for the first time in history
perhaps, a Yankee soldier operated a
French streetcar. In the meantime
the young woman, screening herself
from observation, took steps to avoid
the impending calamity. When all
was well she turned to me with a blush
and a 'Merci, monsieur!’, and I resigned
the car to her once more."

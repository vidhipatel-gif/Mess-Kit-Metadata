PETITE

Dusk, and the trailing shadows, and the drift
Of golden clouds beyond the sunset hills;
The old gray church, the slope where crosses lift
Their suppliant arms; the dale where Springtims spills
The daisies in the grass; a crumbling wall,
Vine-clad and green with moss, and over all.
Your baby laughter and your smile, my sweet,
Brighter than all the daisies, ma petite.
Listen! The fledglings twitter in their nests.
This is the hour of fairies and of dreams,
When twilights gentle benediction rests
Upon the meadows, and the suns last beams
Spread forth their golden wings and fly away.
So let us take a little time to play
Though Might an Might in bitter conflict meet,
And the world's heart be heavy, ma petite.
He would not have you sorrow, he who strode
Into the sunset with your baby kiss
Fresh on his lips, as down the village road
The poilus marched on such a day as this.
Smile then, mignonne-for love of you he sleeps
In Flanders..... Hark! What stirs in yonder deeps?
Surely it was the fall of angel feetÂ¬
Surely I heard a whisper, "Ma petite!"

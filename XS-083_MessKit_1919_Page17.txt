TRIALS
OF
A
BUCK.
By S.T.B.
I've got my orders in my pocket
sending me back to the States for 
discharge. Thought some of the boys
would like to know how I come to
possess such orders, so between now
and the time I go to bed for the last
time before I leave the Army of Occu¬
pation I'll try and retrace my terrible
experiences.
I first secured permission from my
squad leader to see the company clerk.
On entering his private sanctum he
looked up and said, “What in hell you
want? Can’t you see l’m busy?"
"I want to see about going home”,
I says.
"That’s all right”, says he; “run along
home now and don't bother me. I ain't
got no objections."
Well, after a little persuasion, during
which time I invited him out behind
the kitchen, he gave me permission to
enter the Top's den.
"Oh!" said the Top getting up off his
bunk, "I thought you was the colonel.
What in hell do you want?"
“I want to see about going home”,
I says to him.
The Top looked at me for a while
kind of funny and then he asks me if
l’ve got all my K.P. done. “You got
all them pans washed?"
"Yes”, I says.
"All right then", he says, "you can
go."
I still stood there kind of stunned.
I couldn’t see why the medical author-
ities didn’t grab him off a long time
ago. But finally he wants to know why
I don’t beat it and let him go to sleep.
When he found out what I wanted, he
sent me over to the loot to see what
could be done for me there.
I knocked on the loot’s door kind of
easy at first and didn't get no answer.
I thought maybe he was asleep, so
I kicked it.
“Come in!", somebody yelled, so I
pushed open the door and walked in
making sure I had left the way clear
for a retreat by leaving the door open.
"I guess if nobody told you to come in,
you’d break in”, the loot says. “What
in hell do you want?"
"I want to see about going home”,
I says.
“Shut the door, damnit!”, he shouts at
me. "What's this about going home?",
he says. "Hey, I ain't got enough
cards."
I stood there waiting while the two
loots quarreled about the fifth card.
"I give you five cards”, the other loot
says.
“No, you didn’t”, says the loot I was
waiting to parley avick. “I only got
three aces and a jack. Where’s the
other card?"
"Misdeal”, says the other loot and
began raking in the cards.
"Well", says the loot, after he’d laid
down three kings to a pair of sixes;
“so you want to go home, do you?”
I ain’t the only one”, I says, but I
guess he didn't hear me. 
“Go over and see the captain”, he
says; “he’ll fix you up. Goodbye!
Hope you don’t get seasick."
Well, I finally found the captain’s
billet and knocked on the door a couple
of times, but didn’t get no answer.
I thought maybe he’d gone down town
after supper, so I sat down and waited.
After being a kitchen cop all day I felt
kind of sleepy and thought maybe I'd
better go to bed and see the skipper in
the morning. Then I thought maybe
l’d better waid awhile.
I must of went to sleep, and when I
woke up taps was blowing over by
divisional headquarters and I though
it was raining on me. ButI finally dis¬
covered that it was only the captain
emptying out a bucket of water after
having a nice comfortable foot bath.
I got up and saluted and he says,
"What in hell do you want? What were
you doing sitting out there in front of
my door asleep?" 
"I was waiting to see you”, I says.
“Why didn’t you come in and see
me?", he wants to know. 
"I knocked”, I says.
"I was asleep, I guess”, he says,
stretching himself. “What do you
want to see me about?”
“I want to see about going home”,
I says.
“Well, what about it?”, he comes back
at me.
"I got dependants and a sick mother
and--"
“You need a hair cut”, he says,
looking at me in the moonlight. 
"You get right out of here and don't
show up again until you’ve got that fur
all clipped off!"
I said, Yes, sir”, and went to bed.
Well, this morning I got up and went
and had a haircut and then I went over
to see the skipper. He wasn’t feeling
so bad as he was the night before and
when I reported I said “Sir, I have cut
my hair."
"Well, what in hell have I got to do
about it?", he wants to know. 
Then when I explained that he had
ordered it done, he kind of fell to the
fact that he was sort of vanned up the
night before and told me that if I wanted
to see what had become of my applica-
tion to go home, to go over and speak
to the sergeant major about it.
I got in as far as the sergeant major's
door when an orderly stopped me and
wanted to know what in hell I wanted
in there. 
Well, finally I got to see the sergeant
major and he says, "What in hell do
you want?"
"I want to see what you done with
my application to go home”, I says.
He thought awhile and then he tells
me that the orders had come through
about a week ago and had been sent
over to my Top.
Well, I went back over to the Top and
he says they are lost. "I don’t know
what become of them”, he says. "I had
em around here about a week ago.
Don’t worry none”, he says, “maybe
we will find them in a week or two."
I went to the company clerk about it
and he looked all over the place and
then finally found them under the
typewriter. “What in hell do you
want with these things?”, he says when
he had found them. “Better wait and
go home with the bunch."
"No”, I said, thank you. I am going
to run along and pack up now.”
"Well", he says, kind of sorrowful,
“give the boys in the States my best
regards and--"
"Don’t bother me”, I says; "I'm
busy."
Now l’m wondering if Pa will want
to know what in hell l’m doing coming
back ahead of the regiment. I’m won¬
dering, too, if Ma will say, "What in
hell do you want in the kitchen?"

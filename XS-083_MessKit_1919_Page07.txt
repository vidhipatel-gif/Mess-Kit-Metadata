AMERICANS WITH HORNS
CURIOSITIES TO FRENCH.
One of the “double-v” units numbers
in its ranks a practical joke who
generally scores a bullseye because he
never “pulls” the same thing twice.
Despite his long sojourn in France he
still succeeds in putting something over
on the poilus at regular intervals. For
some months he had spread the report
that inhabitants of certain portions of
America’s wild western plains had
horns.
“And the first unit of horned speci¬
mens that comes over, I will show
them to you”, he promised. When
weeks and months passed by without
a redemption ofthe promise, the French
began to doubt the Yankee’s word.
Then one day he announced to a group
of French friends that a detachment of
Americans had arrived, most of whom
had horns.
He led them to a spot where a concert
was being given by one of the regiment-
al brass bands. “Most of ’em have
horns”, he said as he broke away to a
flying start.
SAYS BATTLEFIELD WAS
LIKE BASEBALL GROUND.
No Man’s Lad has been likened to
everything from Hell up and back
again. One usually thinks of it as a
godforsaken looking waste, full of
shellholes, scattered equipment and
bodies of men who fell in action. But
in the last big push in the Argonne
fight, after the Jerrys were driven well
out of the woods, things took on a
somewhat different aspect, according to
a doughboy from New York.
He was an ardent baseball fan in his
civilian days and lost none of his keen
appreciation forthe great national game,
even in the face of the bitter fighting
that “wound up” the war.
“It was a beautiful day when we
started the last big push”, says this
doughboy. “We had the Jerrys where
we wanted ’em at last—out in the
open. No Man’s Land looks mostly like
a littered backyard. But this was dif¬
ferent. The space spread out nice and
even—just like a big baseball field.
Reminded me of the Polo Grounds,
back home."

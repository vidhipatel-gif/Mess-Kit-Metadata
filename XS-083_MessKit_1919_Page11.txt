THE FEDERATION OF THE WORLD.
Then I gazed into the future, as far as human eye could see,
Saw the future of the world, and all the wonders then to be-
Heard the heavens filled with shouting, while there rained a ghastly dew,
From the nations airy navies, grappling in the central blue.
Till the war drums throbbed no longer, and the battle flags were furled,
In the parliament of Man, and the Federation of the World.
— TENNYSON.
Nations come and go in this world. Man and the world remain. Rome and
Carthage are but names now. Spain is a shadow of a former world power.
Turkey is down and out, today but the name of a small strip of land. Austria
and Germany are well along the toboggan. Russia is seasick and also suffering
with aches and pains up and down her back. New countries are being born each
minute, each hour almost,— and perhaps they will disappear as fast. Pro-
paganda is being spread everywhere— surely this is an age of propaganda. Not
the only age, of course,— but surely one most pitiful.
Five thousand years of killing and murder— which is war— have been ended,
we hope. Battle flags and battle songs, the call to arms, the contests between
diplomats and kings, between ambition and false objectives,—these things
have been. We hope they will not have place in the world of tomorrow. We
wish the Federation of the World and the peoples thereof, the parliament of
Man, of which Tennyson speaks, and of which Bobby Burns writes, when he
declares that “a man’s a man for all that”. And if such a change is to come,-
well, we’re mighty glad that we’ve had this war. We’re glad only IF. Other-
wise, we have more work to do.
INDIGESTION.
Dedicated to Mess Sgts.
Yesterday morning
One of our Privates
Went to the
Infirmary and
Complained of
Indigestion.
The medical officer
Recommended a
Few CC's
But they were of
No avail.
Then the officer
Said, Try this,
And he brought forth
Castor oil and salts.
But the results were
The same.
At last the officer
Inquired, What company
Are you from?
And the private said,
Company—
Oh! exclaimed the
Officer.
He then produced a
Few francs and said:
You don’t need medicine,
What you need is
Something to
Eat.

THIRD ARMY CURRENCY.
Soap! Soap! Soap! Soap!
You little piece of yellow soap.
At home for five small cents it's sold,
But here it's worth its weight in gold -
Soap! Soap! Soap! Soap!
Soap! Soap! Soap! Soap!
Any kind og cake of soap.
At home we bring the girls bouquets, 
But here they have the soapy craze -
Soap! Soap! Soap!
Soap! Soap! Soap! Soap!
A little piece of washing soap.
No coin is good that you possess,
But show them soap and they'll say, yes, 
Soap! Soap! Soap!
Soap! Soap! Soap! Soap!
It takes but just a bit of soap
To buy an iron cross or two
Or get a gut an awful stew.-
Soap! Soap! Soap!
Soap! Soap! Soap! Soap!
Fill your pockets full of soap. 
Then you are fixed with every Hun, 
And you can have just gobs of fun,
With Soap-Soap-Soap.

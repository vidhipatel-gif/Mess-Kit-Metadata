THE MESS KIT.
PAGE THIRTEEN.
"GOOFINOLA" LATEST YET.
Makes Noise Like Bass Drum on Spree,
Looks Like Grecian Vase With Broom
Stick Trying to Sprout in One End.
PUTS PEP IN JAZZ BAND.
SINCE the time of the
sackbut and the
tom-tom, not to
mention Poe’s angel,
“whose heartstrings
were a lute”, there
have been all kinds
of musical instru¬
ments, designed to
sooth the savage breast or give the
welkin nervous prostration.
The latest of these is one of the
strangest of all. It is called a Goofi¬
nola and is said to be the invention of
the A.E.F. The Goofinola is intended
to add jazz to jazz orchestras.
The Goofinola is made of a small
barrel or keg with a drum head stretch-
ed accross the top. In the drum
head a two-foot stick is fastened. It is
sandpapered and covered with rosin.
To play the Goofinola the performer
grips the end of the stick with his hand
and pulls his hand down toward the
drum head in a series of jerking
motions. The noise is somewhat like
that of a bass drum, but more wierd,
prolonged and jazzful.
What is believed to be the original
model of the Goofinola is now in the
hand of one of the engineering organ¬
izations. It is painted to represent a
Greek vase. There is a frieze running
around the center which at a distance
of six feet or so appears to be a Greek
decoration. A “closeup”, however,
discloses that the design represents a
minstrel show in full blast.
All who have heard the Goofinola
declare that no jazz band or jazz orches-
tra is complete without it. Anyone
with a keen ear for music can learn to
play the Goofinola, but only a Goof can
become an expert on this strange new
instrument.
A Landlubber's Conclusion.
Doughboy:—What rank has that
sailor with the eagle on his sleeve?
Engineer:—Dunno; must be a colonel
in the navy.
PRIVATE MUSINGS OF A PRIVATE.
By Frank W. BARTON. 
Latest advices from the States tell us that O.D. is going out of favor as
a fashionable color for men's suits.
Good-bye O.D.,
I would be free,
You’ve clothed my frame
Too long for me.
I want some clothes
With room,—and hose
All red and green,
A tie of rose.
I'll walk the rue
With hose to view,
Hands in my jeans,
Coat open too.
With dicer crown
I'll rule the town
And no M.P.
To call me down.
And so it’s the reverse on the old
verse.
T’m leaving the army now
To go behind the plow,
l'II cross that ditch
And yet get rich.
l’m leaving the army now.
The Three-Striper Speaks.
Maybe I left my plow
Like Putnam did, they say.
But l’m going back to it now
And lay my gun away.
With that old girl of mine
I'll settle down for life,
The cows and pigs, I find,
Are just the thing,—and a wife.
l've sighted no man's land,
My own l’d rather see,
It's fun to gun the Hun,
But those pheasants wait for me.
I'll join the village band,
I'll sing and dance my fill,
In politics take a hand
And run for cunstable.
I'll fill that jail, that's me,
And those who wore in France
Sam Browne, “Y.M.”, “M.P.”
Will take an awful chance.
One Phase of War.
At the front of the front there's a trench
Where shells cavort about,
At the rear of the front is a trench
Where they put you when you’re knocked out.
Another.
It's bacon and beans
With all that means
And a bullet may end your life,
But he'd rather be
In France, you see,
Away from his anti-booze wife.
And Still Another.
The knights of old in France we're told,
With vows to Heaven given,
On chargers bold trod town and wold
And tyrant’s chains were riven;
Each wore a sleeve, if we’d believe,
Or other guarded token
Of some one fair his dreams to share,
A flower of tint unspoken.
That time has fled when bold knights bled
And when, before the years had sped,
In charming France, land that enchants,
Arose romance.
The years have rolled and knighthood bold
Into the past departed,
Yet in these days grim war still preys
And dares the boldest hearted;
A thing of steel and scorching wheel
I drive,—no horse, crusading,
Yet at my wrist a token’s twist,
A girl my thought’s invading.
That time has fied when bold knights bled
And yet, tho ages long have sped,
In charming France, land that enchants,
Arose romance.
Beneath some tower or latticed bower,
Like knight on charger prancing,
I catch a smile, a rose the while
That sets my blood a dancing;
And down each way with color gay
Some keen adventure’s lurking,
Nor princess, found, by giant bound,
Would see me danger shirking.
That time has fled when bold knights bled
And yet, tho ages long have sped.
In charming France, land that enchants,
Arose romance.

THE MESS KIT.
BING! AND BATTLE IS ON.
Empty Tobbacco Cans, Old Magazines,
Other Harmless Missles Used When
"War" Is Fought on Indoor Basis.
“NIGHT BARRAGE" IN WARD.
BANG! Clang! Bing!"
etc., as far as you care
to go with it. It
would take a goodly
portion of the diction¬
ary of noiseful phrases
to express it fully, for.
it is no less a war
incident than a night barrage.
Not the kind that used to sweep over
No Man’s Land, ripping white and red
patches out of the dark and “tearin’
hell outa things” until the fellows began
silently to pray for dawn. This bar-
rage has nothing to do with No Man's
Land. It is staged in Everyman’s
Land—that is to say, every man who
has been wounded, is being patched
up, and is getting better. It is the night
barrage in the convalescent ward in a
base hospital.
When the lights have gone out and
everything is still,—bing! clackety¬
clack-clack-bam!"—an empty tobacco
can crashes against the wall.
The patients at one end of the ward
represent the German army, and the
fellows at the other end assume their
old familiar role of Yanks. Tobacco
cans, old magazines and other harmless
missles are used. A chap who lost a
leg or part of an arm at St.Mihiel or
in the Argonne Forest raises up, hurls
the autobiography of Ella Wheeler
Wilcox or the observations of Mister
Dooley in the general direction of the
“German" position, and ducks under
the blankets with a “whoopie!”.
Somebody starts up the Powder River
War Cry while they “let the Jerrys
have it, hot an’ heavy”.
A pause, and then the storm breaks
from the other direction. The pseudo
“Jerrys” are returning the compliment.
“Soak dot Teufel Hund der eye in yet!"
Over comes a shower of tobacco cans
and magazines. And then from his
listening post at the door, a soldier
sings out, “Duck fellers! The nurse
is comin’!"
A ROMANCE OF THE ROMAMCE LANGUAGE.
(This is what he told her in English:)
Boatman’s Serenade.
Give me: the surging stream, its murmuring
shore
Fringed with the darkling wood, the towering
pine;
Let me but feel your heart beats time the oar,
While starry eyes gleam love, your cheek to
mine.
What the o’er boiling deep the darkness low’r
And lonesome wind through tree-tops chilly
whine,
Tho to your heaving breast the white-caps
roar,
Let starry eyes gleam love, your lips to mine
With only the presence of your gentle form.
From live and love pulsating by my side,
Let me sweep my oar, no matter what the
storm,
And down life’s turgid flood my birch-bark
guide.
(And this is the way he translated it
for her in French:)
Give me the ocean and a craft
And you and me, l guess;
We’ll fly away at break of day,
My girlish girlie, yes.
Maybe the lamp is on the blink
And maybe typhoons be;
We’ll wait for sunlight, I don’t think;
Just take a chance with me.
Just you and me and life, you see,
And love besides, I vow,
Upon the tide, c'est assez, oui,
I guess as how.
(And this is what she said in French:)
If you sail like you parley-voo,
I think we’d better stay on land;
For, should we leave as you want to.
We’d be wrecked out of hand.
A bungalow's a safer craft
And, if you love me like you said.
You'll build me one, and not a raft,
And we’ll try life in that instead.
But all he understood was: Water,—no
good for me.
So he bought her a drink of beer.
And they lived happy ever after.
Died Happy, At That.
Quarters:—Jonesy got drowned, did
you say? How did it happen?
A.W.O.L.:—He opened a bottle of
old wine with a pocket knife.
DOG DESERTS REGIMENT.
French-American “Purp" Boards Ship for
Land of Brave Bow-Wows and of Free
Ki-Yis, Goes AWOL to Land of Liberty.
HANKERS TO VISIT U.S.A.
HEISA French American
dog and his name is
Joffre. He was born
in the south of
France. His father is
a French fox terrier
and his mother in an
American dog of the
same breed. The romance of Joffre's
father and mother, although entirely
overlooked by Robert W. Chambers
and G. B. McCutcheon, deserves at least
passing mention here. Monsieur Spot,
Joffre’s father, was adopted as mascot
by one of the engineer units. Somehow
or other the French mademoiselle dogs
did not appeal to him. Then came
Miss Queen, a fox terrier after his own
heart. She arrived fresh from Amer¬
ica, aboard a troopship.
She joined Private Spot’s company
and formed the acquaintanceship of
Private Spot. They became friends:
The friendship ripened into love. And
then, "Joffre”, one of several sons.
From the very first, Joffre displayed
an inordinate love of adventure. He
was always going AWOL and the only
thing that has saved him from a dozen
courtmartials is the fact that he has
four legs instead of two.
Some time ago came the climax of
Joffre’s misdoings. He had not “pulled
anything off” for some time, so the
members of the company were rather
expecting something to break before
long. And break it did. Joffre turned
up missing one day. “AWOL again”,
said the top sergeant. “We’ll have to
tie him up in the guardhouse when he
comes back.”
But Joffre did not come back. When
several days had gone by and he did
not put in an appearance, an investi¬
gation was made.
Result: It was learned that Joffre
had put over the biggest AWOL yet
recorded. He had deserted, got aboard
a troopship and was on his way to the
United States.

THE MESS KIT.
Where Did You Git Them Pants?", Says I;
From Your Uncle Samuel!", Says Jerry.
OLD is the story, as
popular stories go, of
how the Yanks cut
off the German
prisoners’ suspender
buttons to keep them
(the Germans, not the
suspender buttons) from making their
escape. Old, but always good, and
upon the testimony of a few hundred
thousand witnesses, true. Now comes
the latest development of the tale of
amputated buttons, the sequel so to
speak, of the Yarn of Unsuspended
Interest. The Yanks, it seems, when
they had taken their prisoners back of
the lines, not only replaced the late
lamented buttons, but, in doing so,
gave the captives buttons with trousers
attached.
To these the Yanks added blouses
and in cases where they were needed,
rubber boots. In the case of Austrian
prisoners, whose uniform is green, the
uniforms with which they were equip¬
ped by their American captors were
dyed the regulation emerald hue.
In road work in France it is no
uncommon sight to see a detachment
of Austrian prisoners equipped from
crown to sole with warm, durable cloth-
ing furnished by the Americans.
Fritz is what is known as “a big
eater” under all conditions. Even the,
to him, depressing news of the armis¬
tice, spelling the doom of Kultur and
the German cause, dit not impair his
appetite to any appreciable extent. Nor
were his rations curtailed in the least.
Poetically speaking, the heart and soul
plays a big part in international strug-
gles, but the idea of the practical Yank
is to base his humanity upon the filling
of his enemy’s belly, once that enemy
has fallen into his hands.
“Sure we feed ’em and clothe ’em
well”, said one sergeant in charge of a
detachment of German prisoners, “d’ye
think we’d starve ’em and let ’em go
naked? Abuse of prisoners is not in
our line. We have fought a square
fight from start to finish—from the
S.O.S. to the front line trenches. That's
one reason why we carried ’er through
to a smashing finish.
“Not that we baby ’em any. They’ve
got work to do and they’ve got to do it
and do it right. Our own fellows kick
in and do their share and the other
fellow is expected to do the same. A
square deal that doesn’t work both ways
is no square deal at all."
BUTTON SHOES TABOO;
HE'S BACK ON HOBNAILS.
A private who had made a consid¬
erable “cleaning” in a crap game,
decided to invest a portion of his gains
in a pair of “store” shoes. And there¬
upon hangs a sad narrative.
The soldier got a pass to one of the
base ports which was near his camp.
and after a few hours’ window shopping
found a set of foot gear that captured
his eye.
The storekeeper demanded 72 francs
for the pair, and since that figure cor¬
responded with the price tag, the buck
paid over the amount without a mur¬
mur.
He donned his brace of bright yellow
“lady-killers” and went out for a
promenade with his old “hobnails"
under his arm.
Everyone seemed to look at his feet,
but he took this for admiration and
walked proudly on. But at one of the
corners he was stopped by one of the
upholders of law and order.
"Button shoes”, pronounced the
M.P., “do not come under the head of
regulation issue."
The private changed back to his
hobnails when he found that argu-
ments were unavailing. At the store
he tried to change his purchase for a
pair of shoes that laced. But he had
already scuffed them beyond the pos¬
sibility of exchange.
“Oh, well”, said he, as he went back
to camp with his non-regulation shoes
under his arm, “l’ll soon be able to
wear ’em with a suit of civvy clothes."

2 YARNS ABOUT IRISHER;
NAME IS 'BILL' NOT 'PAT’.
So many fictitious stories are told
concerning the spontaneous wit of the
Irish, that these two true stories should
be acceptable, in the interests of variety.
Both concern one Irishman, a buck
private in the A.E.F. whose irrepressi-
ble humor has worked either favorably
or unfavorably for him on more than
one occasion.
One of the unfavorable times oc¬
curred when the company was lined up
for inspection. The Irishman, whose
name is not “Pat”, but Bill, presented
a gun whose appearance could not be
described as either spick or span.
"What's the matter with this gun?",
demanded the captain.
"I don’t know, sir”, said Private
Bill, “it ain’t mine, sir."
Whose is it?", demanded the cap¬
tain.
“The government's, sir", replied
Private Bill. The after effects of this
remark, he was permitted to reflect
upon in the guard house.
An occasion where Private Bill’s wit
brought pleasure to all concerned, was
payday. Bill flourished a handful of
five franc notes in the company hut
and shouted: “Vin Blanc Detail, fall
in!"
A platoon of tried and trusty drink¬
ers of fermented grape juice came
briskly to attention and Private Bill
marched his detachment to the nearby
village.

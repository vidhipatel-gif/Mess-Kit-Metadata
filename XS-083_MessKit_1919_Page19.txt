A LA BOUCHE.
It a body meet a body
Coming down the rue
It a body kiss a body,
Thats a "How-de-do":
But kissing à la Française
Isn't kissing true;
One kiss upon the bouche is worth
The two upon the joue.
Now if a bunch of whiskers kiss,
Mingling with my beard—
'Tis wasted sweetness gone amiss,
And homicide is feared.
For kissing à la Française
Isn't kissing right;
Man's osculations sure to drive
A Yankee man to fight.
I'm cross and sour - a pessimist, 
Les jeunes filles pass me by¬
Too old to firt, am never kissed¬
Why should a body cry?
For kissing à la Française,
I surely can but see,
Is only half the fun of old. —
Not whats smacked up to be.

FRENCH OYSTER GIRL IS LIKE WAIF FROM ANDERSON'S OR DICKENS' BOOK.
IN one of France's base ports is a little girl who deserves a
place in literature beside Hans Anderson's Little Match Girl
and Little Nell of Dickens' Old Curiosity Shop. Matches and
toys lend themselves readily to the fancy of novelists, and
tellers of fairy tales, but this little French girl has no such
claim upon the imagination, Her's is the rather prosaic calling
of vending oysters. The poetic and artistic value of oysters is
more or less open to discussion, but when one thinks of them
as the stock in trade of a wistful-eyed little demoiselle of eight,
they take on a new aspect. 
REFLECTIONS.
I was hungry for something that evening,
The crowd that had gathered was gay,
They chuckled and laughed as they chaffed with
The girl from the Y.M.C.A.
one doye ead die der eye deanng
I challenge you all tonight
To tell little sister a story;
Paint a picture of doughboys lie bright.
They consented vith stories of daring.
One told of a medal he d won
There were tales of prety French maidens
They had courted alas all in fun
At last when all had ceased speaking,
A vouth free from whiskers of time
Arose and related this story
Of a friend he had left behind,
Non ene e depanel Connae
You have boasted of sweethearts too,
But 1 left a treasure behind, friends,
As true as the sky is blue
1 pieture her there in the twilight,
Deserted, sad and alone,
Back in a thick pine forest
Theplace so long called home.
I see her alone in the moonlight,
Standing beneath a tree where
The magie moonbeams are making
A strange catastrophy there.
How quiety vhen duty was ended
I crept to my dug-out warm,
Protected from shrapnel and shell-fire,
I weathered the night minus harm.
She isn't a pretty faced maiden.
Though 1 faney you ll understand,
To a dug-out in No-man s-land.

In common with a good many other
French children, the little oyster
vendor is called Yvette. Every day
she makes the rounds of the restau-
rants and takes orders for oysters on
the half shell, of which the French are
very fond. The food conservation
campaign has left this delicacy un-
touched. Oyster tickets are not requir-
ed and as a consequence, Yvette does
a thriving business.
In réponse to her "Huitres, mes¬
sieurs-dames?", she is rewarded with
enough affirmatives to keep her busy
during the noon and evening meal
hours. Perhaps this is due as much
to her blue, wistful eyes and yellow
curls as to the French taste for oysters.
Blue eyed, flaxen haired children are
something of a rarity in southern
France.
Rags is a route to sympathy usually
employed vhen characters like Yvette
appear in fiction. But Yvette abhors
rags. She keeps her coarse cotton
stockings darned, and her canvass
shoes, gingham dress and black apron
are scrupulously clean at all times.
Like all bread winners, little Yyette
has her troubles. One night when she
was carrying a tray of oysters to a par-
ticularly particular customer, one of 
the waitresses accidentally bumped
into her and spilled the oysters on the
floor. Yvette gathered them up and
came back a few minutes later with a
fresh tray for which the particular cus-
tomer refused to pay, asserting that
she had brought him the oysters that
had been spilled on the floor. 
Perhaps Poulbot, the great child
artist, will drop into one of those res-
taurants some day, and then Yvette's 
appealing little face will figure in
French gift books, journals and art
exhibits.

THE MESS KIT.
NAKED YANKS MUST MARCH THROUGH
COOTIES' INFERNO ON ROAD TO U.S.A.
In other days you stuck to me¬
You were my closest friend.
But now, Pal Cootie, you must flee—
Our comradeship must end!
Chant of the Cootie Killers
“Did you ever see an army of men
going on a forced march minus all their
clothes except their hobnailed field
shoes?”—my friend, who is a sergeant
of Cootie Killers, was speaking. I
admitted that I had not-that the nearest
I had ever come to that experience was
reading Kipling’s story of “The Taking
of Lungtunpen".
We were standing beside a low build-
ing of wood and corrugated iron.
Architecturally it was principally L’s
and wings and other structural diverg-
ences. My friend pointed to a window
in one of the wings, and there, sure
enough, was the Army in the Altogeth-
er. The boys were clumping past in
their hobnailed shoes, and has been
stripped of all other articles of wearing
apparel, useful or ornamental. Even
their identification tags had been
removed.
"What's this?”, I enquired, “the
latest thing in economic uniforms to
meet a shortage in Olive Drab goods?"
The sergeant shook his head. “No,
we are not short on olive drab. But
we are long on—cooties."
I felt surprised, and must have
looked it.
“That is”, he hastened to add, “we
all have them, either practically or
theoretically."
"But couldn't the theoretical cooties
be exterminated by a theoretical cootie
exterminator?”, I asked.
"Uncle Sam isn’t taking any chances”,
he replied, and besides, the bath and
the disinfecting and the change of
clothes will do you good. It’s really
quite an experience."
“Tel me about it”, I requested.
"First of all”, said the sergeant,
“they take your 'dog’ tag. They give
you a slip with a number on it corre-
sponding to the number of a rack in
which you put all your clothes except
your shoes and your wrist watch. You
are allowed to carry a Red Cross bag
with letters, money, and other non-
conductors of cooties. Then you go
tripping along in your hobnails, like
the most fashionable of fashionable
demoiselles when she is shod in French
government shoes and allows her cha¬
telaine bag to dangle gracefully from
her wrist.
"You march past a line of medical
officers who go over you with a micro-
scope and a curry comb and at the same
time whatever cloth goods you do not
exchange for new material, is sent into
another compartment where it is sub¬
mitted to the hot air process. Of all
the hot air in the army, this is the
most effective. No cootie can stand
up under it more than one round.
“In the meantime you go through
another chamber where you swab your¬
self from scalp to sole with some sort
of chemical soap and step under the hot
shower. Then you step into another
room where the barber gives you a
hair cut. You throw your shoes down
in a corner and get a new pair. By
this time you have gathered quite an
armload of clothing and material and
the goods that you are to retain have
been thoroughly disinfected and hot-
aired.
"You step out of the exit, taking the
precaution to throw your clothes on
first. The entire affair has occupied
about half an hour. You walk out into
the open air again, get your bearings
and make a beeline for camp, de-cootied
and ready for embarkation to the good
old U.S.A."
PRIVATES ARE TREATED
TO NEIGHBORLY GOSSIP.
Sh-h! Here’s a bit of French gossip,
fresh from the Advance Section! Mada¬
me So-and-so never wipes her glasses
—she only turns them bottom up after
she washes them! This is an authen¬
tic piece of neighborhood tittle-tattle,
brought back from upthere by a member
of one of the American units who came
down to the Base Port on leave.
“Gossips are gossips the world over”
explained this Yank, “and the French
women are not a bit behind their Amer¬
ican sisters in this respect. When one
of these big hearted motherly French
peasant women invites you to her house
for dinner, you stand a good show of
learning all about the household habits
of the Lady Next Door".
COLUMN FRONT PASSES
AWOL’S PAST SENTRIES.
Yanks who are out after taps without
passes will do well to follow the exam-
ple of a group of artillerymen who
solved the problem in a way that tends
to add to the American soldier’s repu¬
tation for ingenuity.
It was at one of the big artillery train¬
ing camps, shortly before the “outfit'
departed for the Front. A squad of the
boys was out for a farewell lark and
before they realized it, it was past the
time when all good soldiers are sup¬
posed to be tucked in their more or
less downy beds.
Passless, they “put their heads to¬
gether” and considered what was best
to be done. To swagger carelessly in
through the big front gate would mean
sure capture, to sneak in would mean
probable capture, and consequences
even more dire than under the first
conditions.
Finally one of the bucks hit upon a
plan. He lined the others up in twos
and gave the command, “Forward,
march!” The column swung down
the road in higly military style. They
passed three sentries, unchallenged.
When they reached Post N° 1, Guard
House, the buck in charge gave the
command, "Column left, ho!", and the
squad was allowed to pass without
being questioned. All the guards
thought it was a night detail returning
from work.

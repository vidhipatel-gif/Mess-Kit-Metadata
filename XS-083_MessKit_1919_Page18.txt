THE MESS KIT.
PIXIE'S PARTICULAR PAGE.
This is the official Mss. of a-about to be newspaper which will not have its being unless the thing as a whole
is approved by one or more members of the MESS KIT who will stoutly claim and clearly maintain that they are the best
male masculines who have been culled from the literary cubbyholes of the U.S.A. and are, as yet, unspoiled
by commissions.
( )—Not original. (—)—Partly so. Balance altogether so.
PIXIE, the 1st.
"NO NEWS."
Edited now and then and mostly then, sometimes when.
Being an incompleted collection of incomplete writings of people dead and
near dead and those who should be dead, or killed.
Weather:—
Never of any account.
Editors:—
PIXIE and BETTY.
From the “Sarcastic, Sermons” we
print the following:-
TREATING:—
This is not a pastime of the bar; it
was, but it is soon to be past and
barred altogether. The pass word
used to was, “What’ll you have?” and
the high sign a lift on the right arm.
After July First the pass word will
be, “Then was the happy days” and
the high sign will be a reminiscent tear
in the right eye. (That's not saying
which eye it is, however.) (The fore¬
going has nothing to do with those of
our Friends who, claiming they do not
drink, brag of huge quantities of Mon-
tebello consumed; nor those of our
Over Seas Friends who, professing no
interest in the Bond Dry question as
raised on this side of the Globe, still
maintain that Christmas, even in Paris,
would not have been Christmas, had
there not been more than enough
Champagne and tireless Nubian Slaves
to scratch while they drank.)

"TO BE, OR NOT TO BE.
By SHAKESPEARE, the Immortal.
I sometimes think l’d rather crow
And be a rooster, than to roost
And be a crow. But, I dunno.
A rooster, he can roost also,
Which don’t seem fair when crows can’t crow.
Which may help some; still I dunno.
Crows should be glad of one thing, though¬
Nobody thinks of eating crow;
While roosters, they are good enough
For anyone unless they’re tough.
There are lots of tough old roosters, though;
And anyway, a crow can’t crow,
So, maybe roosters stand more show¬
It looks that way. But I dunno.
During the Spanish American War,
unreliable history has it that a humor¬
ous and sarcastic Gentleman of that
period made the statement, “Most
people do not know whether Cuba is
an Island or a brand of canned goods”,
Appro the foregoing (though where it
is going, no one could tell); (the prin¬
ter’s devil, or some other one, left out
an po above, for all of which the editor
asks to be excused); we wish to state
that we cannot decide whether the
League of Nations is a state of mind or
a club. We have not decided whether
Archangel is a statue or a river.
(Since the weilder of the Big Stick
has gone to the Happy Hunting Ground
there is no one to handle any club so
The League of Nations must be a State
of Mind.)
Be that, and all else, as it may, here
is proof positive that there dwells or
the Isle of Earth one real [lyfoolish]
poet; witness the following, and folloy
closely:
Come with me, oh, come with me,
To the Land of Loo-la-lee,
Where the pickles and the nickles
Grow upon the tubsy tree;
Where the cows wear ruffled dresses
Made of wax and watercresses;
Where the parrots live on carrots
And the owls drink taffy tea.
( ) Poem only.
My brain is dull, my sight is foul;
I cannot write a verse or read;—
Then Pallas, take away thine Owl,
And let us have a Lark instead.
T. Hood. ( )
(The Editorial staff would like to
know if T. thinks he can Hood-wink
us into thinking that just because read
and stead end in the same three letters
that they rhyme. Answers may be sent
to the Cider Company of Hood River
apples of which T. Hood is the Mill.)
With this touching bit of the famous
F.P.A.s this paper will come to a
close. (It ought to have been closed
before it was opened.)
"ERRING IN COMPANY."
"If I have erred, I err in company
with Abraham Lincoln."
(Theodore Roosevelt.)
If e'er my rhyming be at fault,
If e'er I chance to scribble dope,
If that my metre ever halt
I err in company with the Pope.
An that my grammar go awry,
An that my English be askrew,
Sooth, I can prove an alibi¬
The Bard of Avon dit it too.
If often toward the bottled grape
My errant fance fondly turns,
Remember, leering jackanape
I err in company with Burns.
If now and then I sigh, "Mine own!'
Unto another’s wedded wife,
Remember, I am not alone¬
Hast ever read Lord Byron's Life?
If frequently I fret and fume,
And absolutely will not smile,
I err in company with Hume,
Old Socrates and T.Carlyle.
If e'er I fail in etiquette,
And foozle on the Proper Stuff,
Regarding manners, don’t forget
A.Tennyson’s were pretty tough.
Eke if I err upon the side
Of talking over much of Me¬
I err, it cannot be denied
In most illustrious company.
F. P. A.
In company with others on the way,
in Cynic commet we assay. We sin,
perhaps, with F.P.V.
Like doeful scribes of witty pen, we
have a sad streak now and then. ’Tis
then that silly wit and fun, Springs up
like bubbles on a bun.
But, we cant help it, you drive us
to it.
PIXIE and BETTY.

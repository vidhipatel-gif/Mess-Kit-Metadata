This metadata was chosen through a process of mental branching, starting at a word and further narrowing. I included
core descriptions such as Title and Date for standard preservation. I added Physical Location and Collection to trace the 
item's origin. I narrowed my categorization by chosing Geography Coverage. While this does note that the newspaper was
published in France, it also immediately reveals the perspective of the literature. World War I was involved with
several countries. By identifying the newspaper as being published in France by the American Expeditionary Forces, it is
easier for researchers to categorize the content's immediate cultural context. Through external research, I determined that 
this is a trench paper, a category for military media. Since there were several kinds of trench papers, it's important to include
the specific Title to distinguish the publications. Notably, the high volume of humor and satire in the papers also makes sense
when considering WHO it is that published it. As mentioned this was published by the A.E.F.'s, thus this publication served at
their primary form of media and entertainment during this difficult period of war. Finally, Subject and Description is used to
indicate any prevalent themes.

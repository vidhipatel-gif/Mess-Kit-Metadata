This metadata was chosen through a process of mental branching, starting at a word and further narrowing. I included
core descriptions such as Title and Date for standard preservation. I added Physical Location and Collection to trace the 
item's origin. I narrowed my categorization by choosing Geography Coverage. While this does note that the newspaper was
published in France, it also immediately reveals the perspective of the literature. World War I was involved with
several countries. By identifying the newspaper as being published in France by the American Expeditionary Forces, it is
easier for researchers to categorize the content's immediate cultural context. Through external research, I determined that 
this is a trench paper, a category for military media. Since there were several kinds of trench papers, it's important to include
the specific Title to distinguish the publications. Notably, the high volume of humor and satire in the papers also makes sense
when considering WHO it is that published it. As mentioned this was published by the A.E.F.'s, thus this publication served at
their primary form of media and entertainment during this difficult period of war. Finally, Subject and Description is used to
indicate any prevalent themes. 



Extracting & Cleaning Text - Reflection
The text of the 20 pages of "The Mess-Kit" was extracted using Transkribus. The accuracy of the raw OCR was moderate and was highly inconsistent across the pages. The main challenge was that the generator read the source strictly from left to right, transcribing across column breaks. Through more usage of the website, I was able to figure out how to group portions of the text to help the OCR process; however, I still had to read through and correct the minor errors that still pertained, such as punctuation, some characters, etc. Another issue was that the software only picked up on the content covered by the line box. If the line didn't cover the entire sentence, it wouldn't transcribe it, forcing me to manually fill in the gaps or correct letters. 
The process of checking every single line was tedious and labor-intensive. The entire process took over 2 entire days and often felt like several simple, repetitive solutions could have been significantly streamlined. For example, allowing me to lock down known elements, like recurring text blocks, would have reduced the need for me to manually re-order sections. This experience really reinforced the argument from one of our readings that human interaction is required for every step of the way. 
Furthermore, the nature of the magazine, with large illustrations, small scattered poems, comic strips, tiny doodles, resisted digitization. The OCR system failed to label or categorize them, leaving big parts of the magazine out in the transcription stage. The constant failure to detect signatures of comics, small symbols, doodles meant that the artistic information of the newspaper is entirely lost in the transcription. 
This entire experience reinforces several of the arguments that have been discussed in the readings. The reliance of such tedious hand-cleaning exposes the invisible, low-paid labor that the archives require. This experience was certainly really eye-opening.

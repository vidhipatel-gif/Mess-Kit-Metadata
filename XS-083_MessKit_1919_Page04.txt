Ex-Soldier

July):-
What is
Home
Without
John
Barleycorn?
DIDN'T WANT TO GET HIT
WITH BOMBS IN POCKET.
“A fellow thinks of a lot of little
details, at a time like that", said a eon¬
valescent soldier not long ago. The
time referred to was the time he was
wounded in the Argonne.
“Just as an example of the numerous
little things you think about under
those conditions”, he said, “I was
stumbling along toward the rear, wing¬
ed, and got to thinking about two hand
grenades I had in my pocket. Hand
grenades are all righl, but your hind
pocket is no place for them when you
have your back to the enemy. So
I reached down in my pocket as I
truged along and tossed the grenades
into a shell hole. I didn't intend to
give Fritz any assistance in case
one of his shells hit me in the pants
pocket."
DON'T LET 'EM REST, WAS
MOTTO THAT BEAT FRITZ.
If you ever have occasion to go
over the top, which you probably
won’t”, said one of the Yankee soldiers
who had "been there”, to one who had
arrived in France a little too late to gel
into the thick of it, “if you ever go
over the top, remember that the secret
of the Americans' success in this scrap
was the fact that they never let the
enemy have any rest. Keep hammering
them. That was what brought the war
out into the open last year, and brought
it to a speedy close. By a concentrated
effort along all fronts, the Allies suc—
ceeded in driving Fritz out of his hole,
and by harassing him continuously
they succeeded in preventing him from
digging in again. It was a case of
following James Whitcomb Riley's
advice, 'Keep a-Pluggin’."
"HOBS" MAR SOLID STONE.
Soldiers May Come and Go, but Their
Footprints Remain on France's Stairs,
Cobblestones and Buildings Forever.
LEAVE TRAIL IN ROCKS.
AGES ago the webfooted
Pollyhickus and other
ante-deluvian mon¬
sters left the prints of
their feet in what has
since become the solid
rock. But modern
Yankee soldiers do
not content them-
selves with leaving the print of their
feet in the as yet unfossilized ooze.
They even go the poet one better in his
advice about “leaving footprints in the
sands of time”. Their hobnailed shoes
are so constructed that they just natu¬
rally leave footprints in everything they
touch whether it be a cow pasture or
the side of a steel tank.
Paving stones in the base ports bear
mute testimony to the ravages of the
hobnail. They are polished smooth as
a hard wood floor and shine like the
proverbial “cullud man’s heel”. Stairs
in cathedral towers that have defied
the foosteps of centuries are beginning
to wear down under the grinding press¬
ure of the modern hobnail. Appar¬
ently the fighting men of old removed
their heavy iron sox and steel field
shoes before they went on climbing
expeditions.
In one of the base ports is a building
where Americans congregate in large
numbers. The three or four flights of
stone stairs in this building have been
hollowed out in the center until they
are almost worn through in places.
Stone vanishes beneath the tread of
the hobnailed shoe like a horse radish
that is rubbed with a rat tail file.
Long after the Yanks have marched
on, the marks of their passing feet will
endure in France's structures of stone.
Slight Misconception.
“Why has Jonesy broken off his
engagement with his girl in the States?
“She wrote and told him she was
going to Training School, and he said,
'Goodnight! I don’t want to spend the
rest of my life with a female second
looie!"
